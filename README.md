After cloning the program, install Python and run managemenent.py from your terminal.

The format of the path that the code requires depends on the Operating System you are using. 
On Windows, the format of the path should be in the form of `C:\Users\Username\Desktop` where `C:` is the drive letter, `Users` is the folder that contains the user's home directory, `Username` is the name of the user profile, and `Desktop` is the folder you want to access.
On Unix-based systems (like macOS or Linux), the format of the path should be in the form of `/Users/Username/Desktop` where `/` is the root directory, `Users` is the folder that contains the user's home directory, `Username` is the name of the user profile, and `Desktop` is the folder you want to access.

The code is set to move the files with the following extensions:
jpg, png, jpeg, pdf, mp3, mp4, wav
